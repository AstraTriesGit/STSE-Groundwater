# Spatio-Temporal Statistics and Econometrics on Groundwater Level Data
This is a bunch of placeholder text. I promise it'll all come together soon.

## Data Collection
The data has been sourced from the [India-WRIS](https://indiawris.gov.in/wris/#/groundWater) Ground Water Levels data
page. The collection has been automated with the help of Selenium.      
Soon(TM): add latitude and longitude data to the datasets being generated by Selenium.
